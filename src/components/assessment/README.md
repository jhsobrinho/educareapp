# Assessment Components

## Overview

The Assessment components provide a comprehensive framework for creating, managing, and analyzing developmental assessments within the Educare platform. These components enable professionals and parents to track child development across multiple domains, identify areas for intervention, and monitor progress over time.

## Core Components

### AssessmentForm

The primary component for conducting developmental assessments.

#### Key Features
- **Multi-domain Assessment**: Evaluate development across motor, cognitive, language, social, adaptive, emotional, and sensory domains
- **Expandable Sections**: Collapsible domain sections for focused assessment
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of completion status
- **Observation Notes**: Text areas for qualitative observations
- **Save & Resume**: Ability to save progress and continue later

#### Usage

```tsx
import AssessmentForm from '@/components/assessment/AssessmentForm';

function AssessmentPage() {
  const { formId } = useParams();
  
  return (
    <AssessmentForm 
      assessmentId={formId} 
      onSave={handleSave} 
      onSubmit={handleSubmit} 
    />
  );
}
```

### AssessmentItem

Individual assessment items within each domain.

#### Key Features
- **Rating Scale**: Standardized rating system (0-5) for skill assessment
- **Item Description**: Clear explanation of developmental skill
- **Age Reference**: Age appropriateness indicator
- **Not Applicable Option**: For skills that cannot be assessed
- **Notes Field**: Item-specific observations

#### Usage

```tsx
import AssessmentItem from '@/components/assessment/AssessmentItem';

function DomainSection() {
  return (
    <div className="domain-items">
      <AssessmentItem
        id="motor-1"
        text="Walks independently"
        domain="motor"
        level={3}
        onChange={handleItemChange}
      />
      {/* Additional items */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### AssessmentSummary

Summary view of assessment results and progress.

#### Key Features
- **Domain Progress**: Visual representation of progress across domains
- **Strength Identification**: Highlighting of advanced areas
- **Area of Need Identification**: Highlighting areas requiring intervention
- **Comparison View**: Current vs. previous assessment comparison
- **Export Options**: PDF and data export capabilities

#### Usage

```tsx
import AssessmentSummary from '@/components/assessment/AssessmentSummary';

function SummaryPage() {
  const { assessment, progress } = useAssessmentData(assessmentId);
  
  return (
    <AssessmentSummary
      assessment={assessment}
      progress={progress}
      showComparison={true}
      previousAssessment={previousData}
    />
  );
}
```

## Supporting Components

### DomainProgress

Visualizes progress in each developmental domain.

#### Key Features
- **Progress Bars**: Visual indicators of domain completion
- **Score Indicators**: Average scores for each domain
- **Color Coding**: Visual differentiation between domains
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### AssessmentControls

Navigation and action controls for assessment forms.

#### Key Features
- **Save Button**: Preserves current progress
- **Submit Button**: Completes the assessment
- **Domain Navigation**: Quick links to different domains
- **Form Validation**: Prevents accidental submission of incomplete assessments

### ObservationSection

Dedicated component for recording qualitative observations.

#### Key Features
- **Rich Text Editor**: Formatted text entry for detailed notes
- **Domain-specific Fields**: Separate observation areas for each domain
- **Character Counter**: Ensures observations stay within length limits
- **Auto-save**: Preserves observations during typing

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface Assessment {
  id: string;
  status: AssessmentStatus;
  title?: string;
  student_id: string;
  student_name?: string;
  evaluator?: string;
  date: string;
  domains: DevelopmentDomain[];
  items: AssessmentItem[];
  observations: Record<string, string>;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
  user_id?: string;
}

interface AssessmentItem {
  id: string;
  domain: DevelopmentDomain;
  text: string;
  level: number | null;
  notes?: string;
  not_applicable?: boolean;
  order_index?: number;
}

type DevelopmentDomain = 
  'motor' | 
  'cognitive' | 
  'language' | 
  'social' | 
  'adaptive' | 
  'emotional' |
  'sensory';

type AssessmentStatus = 'draft' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'archived';
```

### Hooks and Services

#### useAssessmentData

Custom hook for managing assessment data retrieval and updates.

```typescript
const {
  assessment,
  isLoading,
  isSaving,
  progress,
  completedDomains,
  saveAssessment,
  updateItem,
  updateObservation,
  submitAssessment
} = useAssessmentData(assessmentId);
```

#### useAssessmentForm

Hook specifically for form management in assessment components.

```typescript
const {
  form,
  progress,
  isSubmitting,
  savedLocally,
  expandedSections,
  activeDomain,
  completedDomains,
  handleSectionToggle,
  handleObservationChange,
  handleItemUpdate,
  scrollToSection,
  saveProgress,
  submitForm
} = useAssessmentForm(formId);
```

#### AssessmentRepository

Service class for data persistence operations.

```typescript
// Examples of repository methods
const assessment = await AssessmentRepository.getAssessment(id);
const result = await AssessmentRepository.saveAssessment(assessment);
const progress = AssessmentRepository.calculateProgress(assessment);
```

## Integration with Other Modules

### Quiz System Integration
- Assessment results can inform quiz recommendations
- Quiz responses can pre-populate certain assessment items
- Shared domain taxonomy between systems

### Intervention Planning
- Assessment results feed into intervention recommendations
- Tracks progress from interventions through re-assessment
- Links assessment areas of need with specific interventions

### Professional Reports
- Generates professional reports based on assessment data
- Provides visual representations of progress
- Enables comparison across multiple assessments

## Customization

The assessment components can be customized in several ways:

### Domains
- Include/exclude specific developmental domains
- Customize domain labels and descriptions
- Reorder domains as needed

### Rating Scales
- Modify scale range (e.g., 0-3 instead of 0-5)
- Customize level descriptions
- Add or remove "not applicable" option

### Visual Appearance
- Theming through Tailwind classes
- Custom progress visualization
- Branded report generation

## Best Practices

1. **Assessment Integrity**
   - Complete all domains for comprehensive evaluation
   - Include qualitative observations to complement ratings
   - Reassess at regular intervals for progress tracking

2. **User Experience**
   - Save progress frequently
   - Provide clear instructions for each item
   - Offer examples for rating levels

3. **Data Quality**
   - Validate input data
   - Require notes for extreme ratings
   - Timestamp all assessment activities

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Provide text alternatives for visual indicators
   - Support screen readers

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
1. AI-assisted assessment recommendations
2. Standardized score comparisons
3. Video evidence attachment
4. Multi-evaluator assessment support
5. Custom assessment template creation
